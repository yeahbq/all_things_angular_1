# Angular $http

## Introduction

Based on our experience in the last lesson using $http to access APIs
in Angular, your task is to build something _just_ like what we built
together, entirely yourself.

You'll be working on an interface for our **Infamous Criminals™** API
– a database to store & categorize history's most well-known wrong-
doers. The API already exists, but we desperately need your help
creating an Angular application to add criminals to our database,
delete them when they've gone straight, and time permitting, update
their information when their whereabouts change.

## Exercise

- Use $http to access an API resource
- Use $http to POST a new instance of a resource
- Use $http to update an API resource
- Use $http to delete an API resource

#### Starter Code

There's an Express-built API ready to run with a simple `nodemon`. Don't 
forget to have Mongo running and to `npm install`. 

__There's no seed data__ - you'll have to save your own criminals.

#### Deliverable

Build an Angular app from scratch to interface with our RESTful CRUD 
API. Focus on GET/POST first, and tackle PUT/PATCH/DELETE if you have 
time.

Use the included CSS if you wish, but feel free to make your own!
